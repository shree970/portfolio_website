- Generative modelling using GAN,VAE’s and encoder decoder based models for novel drug discovery for corona virus. The drugs    were experimentally validated. The contribution resulted in 2 provisional patents filing.
- Multiple chemical property prediction using various modelling techniques, from ML to deep learning based
(graph representation) techniques.
- Drug-Drug side effect predictions as link prediction task using heterogenous knowledge graphs.
- Trained model for Tabular data extraction from patent pdf’s, using mmdetection framework.
- Built an end to end pipeline for extracting molecules from pdf's using image captioning framework.
