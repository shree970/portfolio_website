- Joined as 1st employee, helped team grew to 10+ people today being involved in end to end model lifecycle development
- Generative modelling using GAN,VAE’s and encoder decoder based models. The contribution resulted in 2 provisional patents for novel architecture developed.
- Setup high computing AI server with linux and user access, and setup as well as manage Gitlab hosting with CI/CD environemnt, defined coding workflows.
- Accelerated ML inference using Numba ,cuDF and optimised python to get 100x performance boost for web deployed platform.
- Using core statistics: MLE, OLS and extensive feature selection techniques along with dimensionality reduction to achieve generalisable model with less than 10% MAPE using minimal available data points.
- Multiple property prediction using various modelling techniques, from ML(MLE, OLS, tree based) to deep learning(LSTM,CNN) based techniques.
- Heterogenous multinodal graphs networks for link prediction tasks.
- Trained from scratch a custom architecture for molecular image into text representation on 800K+ data 
points, inspired from image captioning architecture.
